I’m a data scientist and product manager with 16+ years of experience, primarily across energy and finance, but more recently with big tech.

I was born and raised in Australia, and have had the opportunity to live and work in Singapore, London, and now call the United States home. I served as a Naval Officer and Submariner for seven years before transitioning to the corporate world. And I’ve worked for various organizations since then, including the Australian Treasury Department, Palantir, and Microsoft.

In these roles, I’ve had the opportunity to build and lead teams of data scientists, ML engineers, and product managers — with a focus on driving innovative AI/ML solutions to generate value across several functional areas, including core finance, payments, marketing, upstream energy, and power & utilies. And that experience spans various product types too, such as those for e-commerce, marketplaces (B2B and B2C), predictive maintenance, digital twins, and more.

I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Finance & Economics, a Master’s in Data Science from Northwestern, Master’s in Computer Science from Georgia Tech (with a specialization in AI), and an MBA from Imperial College London. Throughout my career, I’ve always been passionate about the power of data and how it can drive informed decision-making and improved product experiences. I’m excited to continue making an impact across the field by helping organizations make better decisions, products, and overall, extract value through data.

Outside of my day-job, you’ll find me spending my spare time working on a few side projects. Including Datakick, a community-based data science consultancy and recruitment services platform, focused on reinventing the way businesses source and use data talent. DjangoMango, which offers pre-packaged Django SaaS applications, that development teams and individuals can use to quickly build and deploy highly-customizable web applications. And also Alphabots.io, a platform for traders to build and share bots they've created for trading various securities (acquired by Jaaim in 2017).
